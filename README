== Welcome to Open Source Code Crunch

Code Crunch
Women are a minority in most technical communities,
but in open source communities the numbers are even smaller — by a factor of about ten or more.

The Open Source Code Crunch seeks to promote mixed gender collaboration.
Programmers meet monthly in Boston and use their skills towards open source projects in a
welcoming, collaborative, attitude-free, newbie-safe environment.
